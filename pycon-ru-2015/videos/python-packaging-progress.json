  "description": "Python packaging is infamous for being brittle and hard to use. Thankfully, a lot of progress has been made in recent years. This talk will explain some of the components and tools in modern Python packaging including pip, PyPI, virtualenv, and wheels.\nI'd say the talk is for an intermediate to advanced audience. Ideally, attendees will leave with a clearer idea of how Python packaging works as well as an sense of optimism. :)\n",
